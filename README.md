PROJECT SCOPE: Make a Journey into the main Clustering Techniques.

PROJECT RESULTS:
• Collection of the Data through the Performance Monitoring Windows Application (i.e., Built-in dataset).
• Elbow Method and Silhouette Coefficient for making choices on number of components.
• K-Means Clustering Deepening: Lloyd Algorithm, K-Means++ Initialization, Elkan Algorithm, Naive Sharding Initialization
• K-Medians Clustering Deepening.
• K-Medoids Clustering Deepening: PAM, Voronoi Iteration, CLARA and CLARANS Algorithms.
• Mean-Shift Deepening: Object Tracking and Image Segmentation Applications.
• DBSCAN Deepening
• GMM Deepening
• Evaluation Deepening: Silhouette Score, Accuracy, Purity, Rand Index, Adjusted Rand Index, Davies-Bouldin Index
• Final Decision Analysis of the best algorithm given my collected data.
