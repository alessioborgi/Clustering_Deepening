**PROJECT SCOPE**: Deepening in the main Clustering Techniques.

**PROJECT RESULTS**: 
- Data collection through the Performance Monitoring Windows Application (i.e., Built-in dataset). 
- Number of components choice through Elbow Method and Silhouette Coefficient.
- K-Means Clustering Deepening: Lloyd and Elkan Algorithm. K-Means++ and Naïve Sharding Initialization.
- K-Medians Clustering Deepening. 
- K-Medoids Clustering Deepening: PAM, Voronoi Iteration, CLARA and CLARANS Algorithms. 
- Mean-Shift Deepening: Object Tracking and Image Segmentation Applications. 
- DBSCAN Deepening. 
- GMM Deepening. 
- Deepening evaluation Silhouette Score, Accuracy, Purity, Rand Index, Adjusted Rand Index, Davies-Bouldin Index. 
- Final Decision Analysis of the best algorithm given my collected data.
